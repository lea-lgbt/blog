# Lea's Blog

This is going to be a place to write for Lea. It is based on [eleventy-excellent](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent) by [Lene Saile](https://front-end.social/@lene).

## Tech stack

This site uses Eleventy and LightningCSS as a CSS preprocessor.
To get it running, use

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will open a dev server running on localhost:8080, watching for changes.
