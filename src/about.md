Hi, I'm Lea (she/her). I am a nonbinary trans woman, working as a frontend developer with a focus on accessibility and web performance.

I'm based in Hamburg which is a beautiful but quite rainy city in the north of Germany.

## Nonbinary trans woman?

I'm trans. I'm a woman. Together, it's written like this: trans woman (not: transwoman). Trans is an adjective, meaning my assigned gender at birth doesn't equal my actual gender. With "trans" as an adjective, it is just one of many attributes that describe me.

But I also claim the label nonbinary for myself, although I'm still a very binary kind of nonbinary person, as I have a female name, binary female pronouns and a female gender marker. I'm happy with that as of current.

That's totally valid, you can be trans, nonbinary and a woman the same time. Nonbinary doesn't necessarily means being a genderless entity (although it absolutely can). Also, being nonbinary doesn't mean I have to use genderneutral pronouns like they/them or neopronouns. Pronouns are for everyone, especially they are independent from the gender marker (many people get this wrong).

It is important to me to also describe myself as nonbinary because I believe gender is a spectrum and I want to oppose nonbinary hostility. Especially, I want to oppose the ideology of "there are 2 genders, nothing more", denying the existence of intersex and nonbinary people, which is often claimed by gender criticals. Fight the gender criticals.

## Hobbies

I have a [Codepen Profile](https://codepen.io/learosema/) where I love to experiment with web technologies and digital arts.

Apart from sitting in front of the computer, I love to cook and I love to go for a walk; there's no bad weather. At least you have to get used to the rain here ðŸ˜….

## DON'Ts

- in direct messages and chats: don't say "Hello" and nothing else (see [https://nohello.net/](https://nohello.net/)).
- don't ask me if I had _the surgery_, remember I am just a random woman on the internet
- You wouldn't (at least you should'nt) ask a stranger about their genitals.
- Really, that's pretty intimate. It's not your business at all.
- I'm also super uncomfortable with unsocilited flirts from people I don't know and never met.
