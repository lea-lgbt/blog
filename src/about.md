Hi, I'm Lea (she/her). I am a nonbinary trans woman, working as a frontend developer with a focus on accessibility and web performance.

I'm based in Hamburg which is a beautiful but quite rainy city in the north of Germany.

## Things I do

In my spare time, I'm sitting in front of the computer. I have a [Codepen Profile](https://codepen.io/learosema/) where I love to experiment with web technologies and digital arts.

I wrote a WebGL library called [glea](https://github.com/learosema/glea), a vector/matrix arithmetics library called [ella-math](https://github.com/learosema/ella-math). A thing I often use is a [shader-art](https://github.com/shader-art/) web component for running webgl shaders with a few kilobytes of JavaScript. 

Apart from sitting in front of the computer, I love to cook and I love to go for a walk; there's no bad weather. At least you have to get used to the rain over here in the north of Germany ðŸ˜…. Also, I really love to hang out with people and just chat along.

At my 9-5 time, I'm also sitting in front of the computer, doing the stuff that pays the bills. I'm working as a frontend developer with a focus on accessibility and performance, currently at [Novatec Consulting GmbH](https://novatec-gmbh.de).

It's not too long ago since I started over there as a Senior Frontend Developer, May 2022. I got to know very nice colleagues, a lovely team and even made a certification in the competency of Software Architecture (ISAQB Foundation Level).

## Nonbinary trans woman?

I'm a trans woman. It's important to write it as two separate words with _trans_ as short for _transgender_ and as an adjective further describing the woman I am. The combinated word "transwoman" is often used by gender criticals, who claim trans women weren't women, thus making up a new word. I'm trans, but that is just one of many attributes that describe me. 

Also, I claim the label nonbinary for myself, although I'm still a very binary kind of nonbinary person, as I have a female name, binary female pronouns and a female gender marker. I'm happy with that. 

You can be trans, nonbinary and a woman the same time, that's totally valid. Being nonbinary is independent from a legal gender marker. It also doesn't necessarily mean being a genderless entity, although it absolutely can. 

Also, being nonbinary doesn't mean I have to use gender-neutral pronouns like they/them or neopronouns. Pronouns are for everyone, especially they are independent from the gender marker. Many people get this wrong.

I might not fit exactly into one of those two made-up man and woman boxes, but I definitely see myself on the feminine gender spectrum. 

Also, it is important to me to oppose nonbinary hostility and gatekeeping of gender recognition and gender-affirming care. Especially, I want to oppose the ideology of "there are 2 genders, nothing more", which denies the existence of intersex and nonbinary people. This is often claimed by gender criticals and even by some trans people.

## DON'Ts

- in direct messages and chats: don't say "Hello" and nothing else (see [https://nohello.net/](https://nohello.net/)).
- I'm also super uncomfortable with unsocilited flirts from people I don't know.
- No intimate questions if we don't know each other.
